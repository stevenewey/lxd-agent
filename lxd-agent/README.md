lxd-agent
===

This is the x84_64 binary for lxd-agent, taken from an Ubuntu 20.04 system running the lxd 4.12 snap package.
The agent itself is unversioned.

The [license is included](COPYING).

The source can be found at https://github.com/lxc/lxd

**UPDATE**: This is no longer required by the configuration now provided, which builds the agent from source. This remains here for legacy purposes.
